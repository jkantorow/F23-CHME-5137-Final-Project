# F23-CHME-5137-Final-Project
Final Project python files for modeling phenolic resin crosslinking via 2D ISING-like matrix

We could use this space for fleshing out our intro and devising up work if that would be useful for anyone!

## Work Needed:

12/5/23:

* Get on a software like shrodinger to calculate the heat of reaction of a phenolic resin curing with multiple conditions like number / position of functional groups.
* Figure out / tabulate equation for reaction rate / Arrhenius; understand all variables and how they can change.
* Design a way to update the system and system temperature after every iteration.
* Get realistic number of starting functional groups, molecular weights, etc. to input into the simulation for updating with each KMC iteration.
* Make representative graphic of phenol-coal reaction.
* Make a representative graphic of each "event" happening
* Make a logic tree (flow chart) of the pseudocode we are using.
