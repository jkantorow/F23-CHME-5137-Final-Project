"""
A module for the functions involved in building our project for simulating
phenolic resin curing in the presence of coal catalyzed by heat.

We are thinking of using a polymer ising model with kinetic Monte Carlo to
simulate the curing process. We will use a lattice to represent the polymer
components and the coal in an inital state. This lattice will represent a 
cross-section of the system to capture the process of cross-linking.

    Generate an n x n matrix of randomly placed molecules

    All of these "molecules" will be of comparable size for
    simplicity.

    It's important to recognize that the 2D plane of this
    matrix represents the perpendicular cross section of
    multiple parallel resin polymers in close (angstroms)
